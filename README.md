Nacatamal
=========

## What is Nacatamal?

Nacatamal is a deployment tool that I created to help me launch my code to production/development servers. I decided to 
create my own after trying Capistrano and other related tools. I found that there was too many options than what
I needed and I couldn't get them to work. So I created this to make it simple, quick and easy for me.

## Requirements

Nacatamal uses PHP (>= 5.5.9) plus git, zip and tar.

## Installation

Install packages (e.g. in Ubuntu)
```
$ sudo apt-get install -y make git zip unzip tar curl php7.0 php7.0-zip
```

After the packages have been installed, in the root directory, simply run the following:
```
$ cd nacatamal/
$ make install
```
This will download composer and install the required dependencies.

## Getting Started

Before packaging or deploying your projects, please take a look at how to create your [yaml files](config/README.md).

*   To package up your source code:

        php nacatamal nacatamal:package --project=myproject

*   To deploy the newest packaged code base to a server:

        php nacatamal nacatamal:deploy --project=myproject --build=latest --server=prod
        
## Other stuff I am considering

- add some logging information for debug
